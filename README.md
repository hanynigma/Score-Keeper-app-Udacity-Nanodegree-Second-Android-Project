**Score Keeper app Udacity Nanodegree Second Android Project**

This is the repo for \[Android Basics Nanodegree by Google course\].

Project Overview: Build a Score Keeper app

This repo contains the source code of Design and implement a Score
Keeper app that to complete this project, you will need to build a Score
Keeper app. You can either start from scratch, or customize the Court
Counter app you made as part of Practice set 2.

In either case, you will need to select a sport or game to track.
Importantly, you\'ll need to select a sport with either multiple ways to
score points or multiple metrics to track. If you have trouble choosing,
here are some suggestions:

-   Baseball Scores App: Track both runs and outs

-   American Football Scores App: Add a button for each of the 4 amounts
    of points a team can score in American football.

-   Football Scores app: Track both points and fouls.

scored, as in american football, or multiple important metrics to track,
such as fouls, outs, and innings in baseball.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Overall layout</strong></td>
<td>App is divided into two columns, one for each team.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Column contents</strong></td>
<td><p>Each column contains a large TextView to keep track of the
current score for that team.</p>
<p>Optionally, a second TextView to track another important metric such
as fouls can be added.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Score buttons</strong></td>
<td><p>Each column contains multiple buttons. The buttons must track
either:</p>
<p>Each track a different kind of scoring</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Each track a different metric (one score, the other fouls, for
instance).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Reset button</strong></td>
<td>The layout contains a ‘reset’ button.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Best practices</strong></td>
<td><p>"The code adheres to all of the following best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Text sizes are defined in sp</p></li>
<li><p>Lengths are defined in dp</p></li>
<li><p>Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are
not crammed up against each other."</p></li>
